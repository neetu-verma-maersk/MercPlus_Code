</font><b>End of Month - problems in pulling MERC+ reports</b><br>
Usually pulling a report is comparatively fast with the report 
arriving within 5 to 10 seconds.<br>
At month end many users are pulling billing reports and this will occasionally 
delay the reports, sometimes up to several minutes.<br>
<br>
As long as you see a PC icon in lower left corner on your screen with an arrow 
pointing towards the PC icon saying &quot;Downloading from site…..&quot; or &quot;Done&quot; 
something is happening and you should NOT disturb it, instead have a cup of 
coffee or do something else. Only if you receive &quot;The page cannot be displayed&quot; 
error in your browser can you close the page.<br>
<br>
IF you close the page while report is being pulled, the report pulling 
criteria's are stored in your browser. Next time you want pull a report these 
stored criteria are used to pull the report, even if you enter something else on 
MERC+ report request screen, i.e. you will pull the same report time after time. 
This is not the fault of MERC+ but rather part of Microsoft IE Explorer design. 
If you are experiencing this problem the only solution is to restart your 
computer in order to clear all temporary folders.<br>
<br>
Pls. remember to inform your repair shops accordingly.<br>
